*Group Task*

Summary 
------

As a group, you will investigate the research of an academic in your department. Your group will be given the name of your academic, and will have the opportunity to meet them and question them about their research. 
You will then need to summarise what you’ve learned about their work and work together to create a single artefact – for example, a PowerPoint presentation or a leaflet – which communicates the key themes of the research to a nonspecialist audience. 
The academic will see what you have produced, and give you feedback on it. 

Instructions 
------

1. First group meeting: Introduce yourselves to each other. Make sure you learn one another’s names and take each other’s contact details. 
2. Together, read your department’s full Meet Your Researcher assignment brief carefully. Note that together you will need to produce a single communications artefact, such as a PowerPoint presentation, a short video, a leaﬂ et or a detailed poster, which will introduce the staﬀ  member and her or his academic work to a non-specialist audience. Your challenge is to work eﬀ ectively together as a group to complete this assignment by the due date. 
3. During your first meeting, plan a sequence of meetings together, to ensure that you have sufficient time to complete the task. Agree on when and where you will meet. 
4. Week One: undertake as much research as you can - online, through the UCL library and through any other means suggested by your department - into the expertise of your researcher. What is her/his area of specialist interest? Read some of what the staﬀ  member has written: journal articles, books and online publications. Investigate, too, what others have written about the work of your researcher. Make summary notes on your findings. 
5. Second meeting. Discuss your findings with your fellow group members. Begin to agree on an outline or narrative for your communications artefact. Begin to consider which ideas and material you should include, and what type of artefact it should be. Then discuss and agree upon questions you will put to the researcher when you meet her/him in Week Two (see 6 below). Decide in advance who will ask which questions, to make sure that everyone is involved, and agree upon a strategy for noting or recording in some way your researcher’s answers. If you choose to record the meeting, you should ask the researcher’s permission. 
6. Week Two: You will have been given a time, date and room for meeting your researcher. Make sure that you are fully prepared to ask her/him your series of demanding questions, and to take notes so that this information can be discussed, selected and used later in your group’s communications artefact. Your objective for the meeting is to ﬁ nd out what it’s really like to be a researcher in your subject. What does it involve, on a day-to-day basis? What are the highs and lows of research? What is the researcher trying to achieve, and why? How will s/he know when s/he is successful? What excites them about their subject area? 
7. Weeks Three and Four: You will need to work together and perhaps individually on your communications artefact. In the first follow-up meeting of your peer group, agree on your strategy for completing a draft version. Arrange a final meeting to review it before submission, and ensure that it is submitted on time, clearly labelled with the names of your group members. Your Department will give you detailed information about submission, and about how and when you will receive feedback on your work.
