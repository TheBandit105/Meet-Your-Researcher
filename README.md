Meet Your Researcher - Key information for students 
=======

*Group Task*
-----

Summary 
------

As a group, you will investigate the research of an academic in your department. Your group will be given the name of your academic, and will have the opportunity to meet them and question them about their research. 
You will then need to summarise what you’ve learned about their work and work together to create a single artefact – for example, a PowerPoint presentation or a leaflet – which communicates the key themes of the research to a nonspecialist audience. 
The academic will see what you have produced, and give you feedback on it. 

Instructions 
------

1. First group meeting (Welcome Week, team building session): 
  2. Introduce yourselves to each other. Make sure you learn one another’s names and take each other’s contact details. 
  3. As a team, create a Project on [CSGitLab](https://csgitlab.reading.ac.uk) and make sure you are all added as developers.
2. Together, read this ***Meet Your Researcher*** assignment brief carefully. 
 3. Note that together you will need to produce a single *communications artefact*, such as a leaflet, written on CSGitLab, or alternatively a PowerPoint presentation, a short video or a detailed poster, which will introduce the staff member and their academic work to a non-specialist audience.  You must have sufficient detail on the content of your artefact available on CSGitLab for the assessment.
 4. Your challenge is to work effectively together as a group to complete this assignment by the due date (***25th October***). 
3. During your first meeting, plan a sequence of meetings together, to ensure that you have sufficient time to complete the task. 
 4. Agree on when and where you will meet.  You are advised to practice working "remotely" by using the Issue management in CSGitLab.  
 5. Experiment with Issues during the Welcome Week session.
4. Week One: undertake as much research as you can - online (e.g. [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com)), through the university library, etc. -  into the expertise of your researcher. 
 5. What is her/his area of specialist interest? Read some of what the staﬀ  member has written: journal articles, books and online publications. 
 6. Investigate, too, what others have written about the work of your researcher. 
 7. Make summary notes on your findings on CSGitLab.
5. Second meeting (either face to face, or virtually using CSGitLab as a communications tool). 
 6. Discuss your findings with your fellow group members. 
 7. Begin to agree on an outline or narrative for your communications artefact. 
 8. Begin to consider which ideas and material you should include, and what type of artefact it should be. 
 9. Then discuss and agree upon questions you will put to the researcher when you meet her/him in Week Two (depending on their availability). 
 10. Decide in advance who will ask which questions, to make sure that everyone is involved, and agree upon a strategy for noting or recording in some way your researcher’s answers. If you choose to record the meeting, you ***must*** ask (and obtain) the researcher’s permission. 
6. Week Two: 
 7. You will have to arrange a time, date and room for meeting your researcher, obviously with their agreement. 
 8. Make sure that you are fully prepared to ask her/him your series of demanding questions, and to take notes so that this information can be discussed, selected and used later in your group’s communications artefact. Your objective for the meeting is to find out what it’s really like to be a researcher in your subject: 
    9. What does it involve, on a day-to-day basis? 
    10. What are the highs and lows of research? 
    11. What is the researcher trying to achieve, and why? 
    12. How will they know when they is successful? 
    13. What excites them about their subject area? 
7. Weeks Three and Four: 
 8. You will need to work together and perhaps individually on your communications artefact. 
 9. In the first follow-up meeting of your peer group, agree on your strategy for completing a draft version. 
 10. Arrange a final meeting to review it before submission, and ensure that it is submitted on time, clearly labelled with the names of your group members. 
 11. The Project you have created and worked on for this exercise on CSGitLab will be assessed, and feedback on it, and on the communications visible on CSGitLab, so you can evaluate your performance as a team and develop ways to improve.  The feedback will be given on CSGitLab by the 15th Novemebr - hopefully sooner! 


Notes
----

* You might like to look at the source of this document to see how formatting is achieved.  CSGitLab uses Markdown, and there is a simple cheat sheet for [basic Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
* It is perfectly acceptable (indeed, encouraged) to produce a formatted document on CSGitLab as your communications artefact.  
* Note that some researchers are very busy, and some are part time.  You may need to be flexible in how you arrange to have a conversation with them about your findings.
